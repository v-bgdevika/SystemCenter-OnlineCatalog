The Knowledge folder is positioned directly under MonitoringConfiguration since for Beta2 it will apply
to both Monitors and Rules. Since the class representing the Knowledge properties tab is common to all the
types of Monitors, and presumably Rules, only the contents should differ, it is placed in the 
MonitoringConfiguration\Dialogs folder.
